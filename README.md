# loader-robots-system

In this project we implemented a system of robots. They are in charge of picking boxes and devlivering them to their closest destiny point. The destiny point has to have less than 5 boxes in order to consider it an available one. Robots are intelligent agents, but ononly know what is in there neighbor cells and in which coordinate is the closest available destiny point. Thye implementation of the model was done with mesa and flask. While the visuals were done in unity.
