# loader-robots-system

In this project we implemented a system of cleaning robots. They are in charge of picking boxes and devlivering them to their closest destiny point. The destiny point has to have less than 5 boxes, in order to consider it an available one. Robots are intelligent agents, but only know what is in there neighbor cells and the coordinates of all destiny points. The implementation of the model was done with mesa and flask (we only used python). While the visuals were done in unity, C# was used in order for our game to communicate with our flask API.
